# Project4-CreditCardFraudDetection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. Credit card fraud is a major issue for financial institutions, leading to billions in losses annually. Our goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate using historical transaction data.

Dataset
We are using the Credit Card Fraud Data dataset, provided by Neha Roychoudhury on Kaggle. The dataset includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions and is designed to help train machine learning models for fraud detection.

Dataset Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Data
Number of Records: Approximately 280,000 transactions.
Number of Features: 31 columns, including transaction amount, time, and 28 anonymized features. The target column (Class) indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).
Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a given credit card transaction is fraudulent using a machine learning model. Additionally, we aim to identify the key features that are most indicative of fraudulent activity.

Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
Pandas: For data cleaning, handling, and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For training and evaluating machine learning models.
Random Forest: For improving model performance.
Matplotlib/Plotly: For visualizing key insights and model performance.
SQL/MongoDB: For any potential data storage and querying.

Disclaimer:
This project was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT and Xpert Learning Assistant, as well as tutor, Fred Logan. All of which were used for coding guidance, data analysis, and machine learning implementation. The suggestions provided by these AI tools helped us in identifying optimal coding practices, debugging, and understanding complex concepts related to data science and machine learning.
