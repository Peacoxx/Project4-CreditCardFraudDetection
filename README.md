# Project4-CreditCardFraudDetection

Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. Credit card fraud detection is a critical area for financial institutions to reduce unauthorized transactions and minimize monetary losses. By analyzing historical transaction data, we aim to build a predictive model that classifies transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Dataset
We are using the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023, which contains approximately 1 million credit card transactions with both fraud and non-fraud cases.

Dataset Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023
Number of records: ~1 million transactions.
Number of features: 31 columns, including anonymized variables (V1 to V28), Amount, and Class (fraud or not fraud).
Objective
The main goal is to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not by training various machine learning models. This project also explores the features that are most indicative of fraud.

Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis, preprocessing, and model building.
Pandas: For data cleaning, handling, and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For training machine learning models and evaluating performance.
XGBoost: For boosting model accuracy and improving classification performance.
Matplotlib/Plotly: For visualizing key data insights and model evaluation metrics.
SQL/MongoDB: For potential database storage of transaction data.
